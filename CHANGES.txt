3.6.0 (2009-03-12)
==================

- IMPORTANT: the interfaces that were defined in the
  zope.component.bbb.interfaces and deprecated for years are
  now (re)moved. However, some packages, including part of zope
  framework were still using those interfaces. They will be adapted
  for this change. If you were using some of those interfaces, you
  need to adapt your code as well:
  
   - The IView and IDefaultViewName were moved to zope.publisher.interfaces.

   - The IResource was moved to zope.app.publisher.interfaces.

   - IContextDependent, IPresentation, IPresentationRequest,
     IResourceFactory, IViewFactory were removed completely.

     If you used IViewFactory in context of zope.app.form, there's now
     IWidgetFactory in the zope.app.form.interfaces instead.

- Add getNextUtility/queryNextUtility functions that used to be in zope.site
  earlier (and in zope.app.component even more earlier).

- Added a pure-Python 'hookable' implementation, for use when
  'zope.hookable' is not present.

- Removed use of 'zope.deferredimport' by breaking import cycles.

- Cleanup package documentation and changelog a bit. Add sphinx-based
  documentation building command to the buildout.

- Remove deprecated code.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, because
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

3.5.1 (2008-07-25)
==================

- Fix bug introduced in 3.5.0: <utility factory="..."> no longer supported
  interfaces declared in Python and always wanted an explicit provides="..."
  attribute. https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/251865

3.5.0 (2008-07-25)
==================

- Support registration of utilities via factories through the component registry
  and return factory information in the registration information. This fixes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/240631

- Optimized un/registerUtility via storing an optimized data structure for
  efficient retrieval of already registered utilities. This avoids looping over
  all utilities when registering a new one.

3.4.0 (2007-09-29)
==================

No further changes since 3.4.0a1.

3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
====================

Corresponds to zope.component from Zope 3.4.0a1.

- In the Zope 3.3.x series, ``zope.component`` was simplified yet once
  more.  See http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/LocalComponentManagementSimplification
  for the proposal describing the changes.

3.2.0.2 (2006-04-15)
====================

- Fix packaging bug:  'package_dir' must be a *relative* path.

3.2.0.1 (2006-04-14)
====================

- Packaging change: suppress inclusion of 'setup.cfg' in 'sdist' builds.

3.2.0 (2006-01-05)
==================

Corresponds to the verison of the zope.component package shipped as part of
the Zope 3.2.0 release.

- Deprecated services and related APIs. The adapter and utility registries
  are now available directly via the site manager's 'adapters' and 'utilities'
  attributes, respectively.  Services are accessible, but deprecated, and
  will be removed in Zope 3.3.

- Deprectaed all presentation-related APIs, including all view-related
  API functions. Use the adapter API functions instead.
  See http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/ImplementViewsAsAdapters`

- Deprecated 'contextdependent' package:  site managers are now looked up
  via a thread global, set during URL traversal.  The 'context' argument
  is now always optional, and should no longer be passed.

3.0.0 (2004-11-07)
==================

Corresponds to the verison of the zope.component package shipped as part of
the Zope X3.0.0 release.

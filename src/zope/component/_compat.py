# zope.security cannot be imported if zope.interface is enforcing
# strict resolution orders. But because zope.security has a dependency
# on this library, and older versions of this library also have problems
# with strict resolution orders, we have a chicken-and-egg scenario. In the
# interim, our only choice is to skip it. (But we don't want a hard dependency
# on zope.interface 5.0, so we do a conditional import.)
